# Distributed Access Management

Do you have IAM policies in both AWS and Azure? Or do you need to convert AWS IAM policies to Azure policies when migrating from AWS to Azure? Working with so many different types of access (authorization) policies has been the way of life. The goal of this project is to create a distributed access management that can be used AWS, Azure, GCP and all other cloud products just like Active Directory being used by all for identity and authentication management. Before achieving the goal, the project works on converting access policies among different systems. 

This project will serve as proof of concept for the patent pending technology - authorization policy neutral format"Optimized policy data structure for distributed authorization systems."

The difficulty of quantum physics lies in the wave behavior of particles. The focus of theoretical is how to solve the wave equations. And experimental physicists focus on how to control the waves. This book leaves out the details of the waves by labelling them with symbols e.g. "0" and "1". The symbols are what computer science and engineering students know how to work with. They are what the computer science data structure and algorithms, and Shannon information theory apply.
