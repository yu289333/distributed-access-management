# Distributed Access Management

Do you have IAM policies in both AWS and Azure? Or do you need to convert AWS IAM policies to Azure policies when migrating from AWS to Azure? Working with so many different types of access (authorization) policies has been the way of life. The goal of this project is to create a distributed access management that can be used AWS, Azure, GCP and all other cloud products just like Active Directory being used by all for identity and authentication management. Before achieving the goal, the project works on converting access policies among different systems. 

This project will serve as proof of concept for the patent pending technology - authorization policy neutral format "Optimized policy data structure for distributed authorization systems."
